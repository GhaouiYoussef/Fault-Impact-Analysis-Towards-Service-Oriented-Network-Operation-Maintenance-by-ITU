# AI for Good - ITU Machine Learning Competition

Welcome to the AI for Good - ITU Machine Learning Competition! In this competition, your goal is to utilize machine learning techniques to predict the impact of faults on Radio Access Network (RAN) Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). By doing so, you will contribute to the advancement of fault management in telecom Operation & Maintenance (O&M), ultimately enhancing network stability and reliability.

## Background

Fault management in telecom O&M aims to ensure stable and reliable networks and services. In the RAN, fault management involves monitoring, analysis, diagnosis, and repair processes. Fault analysis is particularly crucial for troubleshooting, yet traditional methods often lack explicit assessment of each fault's impact on network KPIs.

## Problem Statement

The challenge is to develop a machine learning-based model to predict how each Network Element's (NE) average data rate changes when a fault occurs, based on network topology and historical data.

### Challenges

- **Uncertainty and non-stationarity in fault impact:** RAN's stochastic nature can lead to instability and fluctuation in KPI data, making it challenging to differentiate between faults and normal variations.
  
- **Complexity of RAN networking and mechanism:** RAN is a complex system with correlated KPIs and intricate fault mechanisms, making it difficult to identify fault impacts.
  
- **Uncertainty contributed by customer segmentations:** User behaviors and requirements introduce stochasticity and uncertainty in RAN KPIs.
  
- **Uncertainty generated by non-RANâ€™s fault:** Fluctuations in KPIs may also result from non-RAN faults, complicating fault impact modeling.

## About AI for Good - ITU

AI for Good is organized by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) in partnership with 40 UN Sister Agencies. It aims to identify practical applications of AI to advance the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and scale those solutions for global impact.

## Evaluation

The error metric for this competition is the F1 score, ranging from 0 (total failure) to 1 (perfect score). Participants will submit a report explaining their modeling solution, including the outcomes on the test set.

### Definitions:

- **F1 Score:** A performance score that combines precision and recall.
- **Precision:** The proportion of true positive predictions out of total positive predictions.
- **Recall (Sensitivity):** The proportion of true positive predictions out of total actual positives.

## Submission Format

Your submission file should include:

An essential aspect of my approach has been the meticulous tuning of thresholds. Recognizing that different algorithms possess varying sensitivities, I've adeptly fine-tuned these thresholds to align with each approach's strengths. By harmonizing the intersection between prediction and true values, I've harnessed the power of anomaly detection. This process has allowed me to effectively distinguish outliers and irregularities, providing a comprehensive view of data dynamics.

This methodology has proven invaluable in my pursuit of unveiling hidden insights and anomalous patterns. By fusing diverse algorithms and optimizing thresholds, I've honed a holistic strategy that enhances the accuracy and reliability of my anomaly detection efforts. This approach not only bolsters my analytical capabilities but also contributes to a more nuanced understanding of complex datasets.

As I continue to navigate the realm of data analysis, my commitment to employing a diverse array of algorithms and fine-tuning thresholds remains steadfast. This approach empowers me to uncover subtle nuances and glean actionable insights from intricate datasets.
