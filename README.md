# My Approach:
My approach to anomaly detection hinges on the meticulous tuning of thresholds, a process designed to capitalize on the varying sensitivities of different algorithms. This approach is pivotal in aligning each algorithm's strengths with the nuances of the dataset at hand. By strategically calibrating thresholds to optimize the intersection between predicted and true values, I harness the inherent power of anomaly detection techniques.

One of the cornerstones of my methodology is the fusion of diverse algorithms, including Catboost, XGBoost, SVM, and others. Each of these algorithms brings its own set of advantages and sensitivities to the table. By integrating them into a cohesive framework, I create a robust analytical pipeline capable of capturing a wide range of data patterns and anomalies.

Fine-tuning thresholds is a delicate yet essential aspect of this approach. It involves iteratively adjusting the threshold values to strike a balance between sensitivity and specificity, ensuring that the model can accurately identify outliers and irregularities while minimizing false positives. This meticulous tuning process allows me to achieve a comprehensive understanding of the data dynamics and extract meaningful insights.

The effectiveness of this approach lies in its ability to unveil hidden insights and anomalous patterns that may otherwise go unnoticed. By combining the strengths of multiple algorithms and optimizing thresholds, I develop a holistic strategy that enhances the accuracy and reliability of anomaly detection efforts.

Moving forward, my commitment to this approach remains unwavering. As I delve deeper into the realm of data analysis, I will continue to leverage a diverse array of algorithms and fine-tune thresholds to uncover subtle nuances and glean actionable insights from complex datasets. This iterative process not only strengthens my analytical capabilities but also deepens my understanding of the intricacies inherent in data analysis and anomaly detection.

# AI for Good - ITU Machine Learning Competition

Welcome to the AI for Good - ITU Machine Learning Competition! In this competition, your goal is to utilize machine learning techniques to predict the impact of faults on Radio Access Network (RAN) Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). By doing so, you will contribute to the advancement of fault management in telecom Operation & Maintenance (O&M), ultimately enhancing network stability and reliability.

## Background

Fault management in telecom O&M aims to ensure stable and reliable networks and services. In the RAN, fault management involves monitoring, analysis, diagnosis, and repair processes. Fault analysis is particularly crucial for troubleshooting, yet traditional methods often lack explicit assessment of each fault's impact on network KPIs.

## Problem Statement

The challenge is to develop a machine learning-based model to predict how each Network Element's (NE) average data rate changes when a fault occurs, based on network topology and historical data.

### Challenges

- **Uncertainty and non-stationarity in fault impact:** RAN's stochastic nature can lead to instability and fluctuation in KPI data, making it challenging to differentiate between faults and normal variations.
  
- **Complexity of RAN networking and mechanism:** RAN is a complex system with correlated KPIs and intricate fault mechanisms, making it difficult to identify fault impacts.
  
- **Uncertainty contributed by customer segmentations:** User behaviors and requirements introduce stochasticity and uncertainty in RAN KPIs.
  
- **Uncertainty generated by non-RANâ€™s fault:** Fluctuations in KPIs may also result from non-RAN faults, complicating fault impact modeling.

## About AI for Good - ITU

AI for Good is organized by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) in partnership with 40 UN Sister Agencies. It aims to identify practical applications of AI to advance the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and scale those solutions for global impact.

## Evaluation

The error metric for this competition is the F1 score, ranging from 0 (total failure) to 1 (perfect score). Participants will submit a report explaining their modeling solution, including the outcomes on the test set.

### Definitions:

- **F1 Score:** A performance score that combines precision and recall.
- **Precision:** The proportion of true positive predictions out of total positive predictions.
- **Recall (Sensitivity):** The proportion of true positive predictions out of total actual positives.
