# Fault-Impact-Analysis-Towards-Service-Oriented-Network-Operation-Maintenance-by-ITU
The goal of fault management in telecom O&M (Operation & Maintenance) is to ensure stable & reliable networks and services. In the RAN (Radio Access Network), the most significant part of O&M activities is network fault management, including fault monitoring, analysis, diagnosis, and repair processes. Among these processes, fault analysis is an essential part of troubleshooting.
In my pursuit of understanding learning patterns, I have embraced a diverse array of algorithms. Through this journey, I've explored the intricacies of multiple approaches, each offering a unique perspective on the data at hand. This multifaceted exploration has not only broadened my analytical toolkit but also enriched my ability to discern underlying trends and anomalies.

An essential aspect of my approach has been the meticulous tuning of thresholds. Recognizing that different algorithms possess varying sensitivities, I've adeptly fine-tuned these thresholds to align with each approach's strengths. By harmonizing the intersection between prediction and true values, I've harnessed the power of anomaly detection. This process has allowed me to effectively distinguish outliers and irregularities, providing a comprehensive view of data dynamics.

This methodology has proven invaluable in my pursuit of unveiling hidden insights and anomalous patterns. By fusing diverse algorithms and optimizing thresholds, I've honed a holistic strategy that enhances the accuracy and reliability of my anomaly detection efforts. This approach not only bolsters my analytical capabilities but also contributes to a more nuanced understanding of complex datasets.

As I continue to navigate the realm of data analysis, my commitment to employing a diverse array of algorithms and fine-tuning thresholds remains steadfast. This approach empowers me to uncover subtle nuances and glean actionable insights from intricate datasets.
